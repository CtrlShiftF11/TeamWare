# TeamWare
TeamWare is a collaboration app for organizations who want to analyze sprint trends for software teams over extended periods of time.  The data is organized by Team, Project and Sprint and the app is completely self contained in that you do not have to integrate with Rally, JIRA, etc.

The project is open source and is still very much under development.

## Requirements
Node.js
MongoDB

Additional deployment documentation will be added as I get closer to releasing a beta version of this freeware.
